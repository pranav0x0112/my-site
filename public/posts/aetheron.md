# Aetheron: Bringing My Own SoC to Life

This is a second sample post for testing the local blog renderer. It demonstrates another code block (C) and some basic markdown features.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Aetheron says hi\n");
  return 0;
}
```

# Aetheron: Bringing My Own SoC to Life

Notes and excerpts from my journey building a RISC-V SoC in Bluespec. This is a test post to validate local markdown rendering.

## Overview

The SoC includes a simple pipeline, memory-mapped peripherals and a small ROM boot flow.

### Sample C

```c
int main() {
  // tiny program
  return 0;
}
```
