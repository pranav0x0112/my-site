# Resona: Rust, RISC-V Assembly, and DSP Kernels

> My first blog! A deep dive into building a tiny DSP-inspired simulator using Rust and hand-written RISC-V Assembly â€” with chaos, bloopers, and all.

This is a sample post copied from the old Hashnode content so we can test local rendering. Below is an example code block and image embed.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Resona!");
}
```

# Resona: Rust, RISC-V Assembly, and DSP Kernels

My first blog! A deep dive into building a tiny DSP-inspired simulator using Rust and hand-written RISC-V Assembly - with chaos, bloopers, and all.

## Introduction

This is a sample post copied from the old Hashnode content for testing. The goal is to verify that local markdown files render properly on the site.

### What you'll find here

- A short write-up
- Code blocks
- Links and images

## Example code

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Resona!");
}
```

## Conclusion

This demonstrates rendering a markdown post from `public/posts/resona.md`.
